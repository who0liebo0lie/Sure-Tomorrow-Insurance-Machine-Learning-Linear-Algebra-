# Sure-Tomorrow-Insurance-Machine-Learning-Linear-Algebra-
Use Machine Learning to find similar customers, predict whether a new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. &amp; number of benefits, and protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.

🔮 Sure Tomorrow – Machine Learning & Linear Algebra Analysis

This notebook explores the foundational mathematics behind linear regression through practical machine learning implementations. It bridges the gap between theory and application, allowing users to understand how linear algebra concepts power predictive models.

📊 Results & Insights
RMSE and ( R^2 ): The RMSE and ( R^2 ) values for both the original and obfuscated datasets are very similar. They only differ by a tenth decimal point.  Providing an indication that the obfuscation process did not significantly impact the performance of the Linear Regression. 

The transformation by an invertible matrix does not degrade the quality of the linear model.In using a random matrix for obfuscation the linear regression maintained the ability to make accurate predictions.

Sensitive data can be obfuscated to protect it without sacrificing the accuracy of predictive models. Sure Tomorrow insurance company is enable to share data more securely.

The linear model performs well with low error (MSE under 5.0)

Gradient descent effectively converged to a solution similar to scikit-learn

Matrix inversion and dot product operations replicate sklearn results with high accuracy
